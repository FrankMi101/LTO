                            <br /> <b style="text-decoration:underline "> Principle: </b> The Toronto Catholic District School Board also recognizes that a high standard is
                            expected of a public body where the employment, contractual, and purchasing requirements may
                            vary widely, and are spread throughout many departments and schools.  It is essential that staff maintain,
                            and are perceived to maintain, the highest standard of public trust and integrity.

                            <br /> <b style="text-decoration:underline "> Policy: </b> Toronto Catholic District School Board expects, consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ, that employees
                            will at all times conduct themselves with personal integrity, ethics, honesty and diligence in the performance of their duties.
                            Employees are expected to support and act in the best interest of the Board. Employees are therefore expected either:

                            <ul>
                                <li>to avoid, as far as practicable, placing themselves in situations in which their personal interests may actually or potentially conflict with the interest of the Board, or </li>
                                <li>at any and all times and places and regardless of whether engaged in or on or about Board business, to take all reasonable steps to avoid the exercise of any influence on Board decisions in which they have personal interest.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <b style="text-decoration:underline "> Regulation:</b> 1.1 the interest, direct or indirect, of the spouse of an employee, or of a parent, sibling or child
                            of an employee or the spouse of any of them, shall, if known to the employee, be deemed to be also the interest of the employee;
